## In-person Services
We're once again offering two in person services for those who want to join us on Sundays.

We encourage everyone to think carefully about whether attending is safe for them and others they're in contact with.

Space is limited to enable social distancing. If you're new and would like to join us in-person, just email the church office to book a place. For our regular church family, please await email invitations.

For those who can't join us, we are still live streaming services morning and evening. [Service times and stream links](/#services) are below and important updates will be posted here.

Updated: *2nd February 2021*
