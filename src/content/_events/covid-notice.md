## Online services 19th September
With regret, due to internet issues, the morning service on 19th September cannot be watched online. We will endeavour to make this service available on YouTube at a later date. Apologies for any inconvenience.

## In-Person Services
We're delighted to offer our Sunday services both in-person and online! You can see our [service times and stream links](/#services) below.

You don't need to book in advance to come in person, just turn up at your preferred time and we'd love to welcome you.

We are retaining some measures to limit the spread of coronavirus. Please read [this short explanation](/attending-in-person) before you come along.

Any important updates will be posted here.
