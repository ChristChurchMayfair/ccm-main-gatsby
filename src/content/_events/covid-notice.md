## In-person Services
We're continuing to offer live streamed and in person services for those who want to join us on Sundays. [Service times and stream links](/#services) are below.

We encourage everyone to think carefully about whether attending is safe for them and others they're in contact with.

Space is limited to enable social distancing. If you're new and would like to join us in-person, just email the church office to book a place. For our regular church family, please await email invitations.

Any important updates will be posted here.
