## In-Person Services
We're delighted to offer our Sunday services both in-person and online! You can see our [service times and stream links](/#services) below.

You now don't need to book in advance for coming in person, just turn up at your preferred time and we'd love to welcome you.

We have retained some measures to limit the spread of coronavirus [which you can see here.](/attendinginperson)

Any important updates will be posted here.
