In the light of Government advice, all Church meetings will now be online. Our two Sunday services will be streamed each week. Midweek groups will be contacted by their leaders.

This Sunday is [Revive Sunday](https://co-mission.org/revive/)! After a short introduction from CCM, we will join with the other Co-Mission churches and watch the main service as it is broadcast from Revive HQ.

An introduction, including a kids' slot, will be broadcast from CCM on [Facebook Live](https://www.facebook.com/christchurch.mayfair.1) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/bfMMbo465CU) at 10:15am.

**The Revive Sunday main session will follow at 10:30am [on the Co-Mission website](https://co-mission.org/revive/).**
