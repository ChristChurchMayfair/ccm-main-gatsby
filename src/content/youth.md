If you have 11-14 year olds, they are welcome to join our Pathfinder youth group.

Their session is held during the morning service and is designed to encourage them to grow in their love and knowledge of Jesus and explore the truths of the Bible in a relaxed, fun environment.

We also run a Friday evening group called Ignite, with games, food, and a talk from the Bible.
