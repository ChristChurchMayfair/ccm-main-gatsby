Welcome to the student work at CCM! Our church is home to students from universities and colleges all over London and we would love for you to join us.

Sundays are our chance to come together and enjoy the diversity of our church family. 

Many students come to the 6pm service, preferring its relaxed, contemporary feel. There is space to enjoy God as we praise him, pray to him and above all as we encounter him through relevant and engaging Bible teaching. We love to spend time together after the service too, often going on to get food nearby. 

Other students prefer the family friendly nature of the 10.30am service.

You'd be really welcome at either service!
