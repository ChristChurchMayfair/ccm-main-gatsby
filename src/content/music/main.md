Worshipping God in song is an essential part of our Sunday services.

We care passionately and think deeply about our music. We choose songs that not only speak of what God has done for us but allow us to express our deep thankfulness to him.

During our morning service we sing contemporary songs and classic hymns. At the evening service, we enjoy extended times of singing in a more informal setting.
