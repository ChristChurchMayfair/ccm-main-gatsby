Help Us Help Others
-------------------

If you want to be able to help members of the church family who are struggling at the moment here are a few ideas:

1. **Talk to people you know**, especially those in church who might be isolated, and ask how they are doing.  People can struggle with loneliness and worry at least as much as practical things, and your listening will help them open up.
2.	If you know someone who might need help with money, you can **refer them to the Deacons Fund** for a chat. The enquiry form is [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jiLqyULkQUe5OOZzBogzKMnPr0uHgmR_wPoonsEOJ4M/edit).
3.	You can also **signpost people to sources of advice** and help. We've listed them above. If you identify resources that you find helpful and would like to be added to this list, please get in touch with [Susie Dye](mailto:deaconsfund@christchurchmayfair.org).
4.	If you have experience of living on a low income, or supporting people who are, and are interested in helping, let us know. We’re exploring recruiting peer supporters to get alongside people.
5.	**Don’t be a solo superhero!** Work with your church family. Please feel free to ask for help or advice. No human has all the answers, and we can all feel a little unsure at times. This is as true in charity and pastoral work – especially in a pandemic! – as anything. 

Proverbs 22:2: “*The rich and poor have this in common: The Lord made them both.*”
