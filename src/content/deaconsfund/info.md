## Why do we need a fund?
Many members of Christ Church Mayfair are blessed financially, and share these blessings with others through giving to ministry and charity, in London and elsewhere. At the same time, some members of the church family experience hardship. We should be distinctive in dealing with these situations.

Many people already share their resources generously person-to-person, sometimes coordinated through DG groups, and this should continue to be the first means of help. Others, however, prefer to give anonymously, without wishing to know the details of individual hardship cases. This is made possible via a Fund.

## Who can benefit?
Priority for support will be given to:
* Members of the church family, indicated by attendance at Sunday services, and some of: bible study groups, prayer meetings, other ministries (e.g. little lambs).
* People experiencing crisis or clear hardship, e.g. due to unemployment, illness, relationship breakdown, bereavement.
* People who do not have, or have exhausted, other sources of support (such as friends, family, NHS, state benefits).
* People who are willing to take action to remedy their situation, through speaking openly with small group leaders, deacons, or church leaders, seeking help for underlying issues, building and following an action plan.

## What can the fund pay for?
The fund can provide *time-limited* support for the following expenses:
* Rent/Mortgage payments
* Essential food & clothing
* Utility bill payments
* Transportation to and from work/church
* Medical treatment or professional counselling (where not covered by the NHS)
* Funeral expenses

Support will be decided case-by-case, and will be accompanied by detailed financial planning.

The current deacons are: 
* Jal Quinn & Adrian Valeriano (10.30am service) 
* Susie Dye & Jo Duckering  (6pm service)

We are all volunteers and members of the church congregations.
