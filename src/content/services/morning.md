Normal mornings at CCM are an informal, family friendly time with Bible teaching for everyone, with both traditional and contemporary worship. We enjoy time all together as a church family and then our children gather in age-specific groups to learn about Jesus for themselves.

Church family life involves spending time with each other after the service, making new friends. We're looking forward to when we catch up over coffee and resume our monthly lunches again.
