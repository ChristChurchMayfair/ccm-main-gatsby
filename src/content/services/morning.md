Mornings at CCM are an informal, family friendly time with Bible teaching for everyone, with both traditional and contemporary worship. We enjoy time all together as a church family and then our children gather in age-specific groups to learn about Jesus for themselves.

Church family life involves spending time with each other after the service, making new friends and catching up over coffee.
