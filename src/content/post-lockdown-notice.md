## We're Gathering Again!

Our 6.00pm service is meeting again and in the coming weeks we'll also resume the 10.15am service.

You're welcome to join us in person but for those who can't we are still live streaming our services online. Service times and stream links are below and we will post any updates here.

_For our regular church family, please await email invitations._
