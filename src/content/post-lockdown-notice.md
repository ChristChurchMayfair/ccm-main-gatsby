## We're Gathering Again!

Our 6.00pm service is meeting in person again and in the coming weeks we'll resume the 10.15am service.

You're welcome to join us in person but for those who can't we are still live streaming our services online. Service times and stream links are below and important updates will be posted here.

_For our regular church family, please await email invitations._
