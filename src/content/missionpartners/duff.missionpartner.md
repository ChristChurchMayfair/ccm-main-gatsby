* Pray that we would be faithful to God's word as we write different resources to help in the discipleship of Rwandan children. 
* Pray that as we write, the DNG team would grow in our understanding and our love for God's. Pray also that through these materials, many parents and children would know and love Jesus even more.
* Pray for DNG 2021 apprentices â€“ that they will be well equipped to teach the Bible faithfully to children in their local churches.
