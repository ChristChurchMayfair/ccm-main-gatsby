* We are both doing theological studies in order to serve the Rwandan people more effectively. Please pray that God would use our studies to equip us for children's work in Rwanda or whatever else he has for us in the future.
* Pray for DNG staff, that we would continue to grow in our capacity and skills to train and produce resources which are much needed in Rwanda for the discipleship of children.
* Pray that through our work, more churches and Christians parents in Rwanda would be able to see the urgency and the importance of the discipleship of children.
