* Pray God would keep us all committed to the body of Christ, and he would strengthen us together.
* Pray for the people who have left our church, along with one of the pastors, to revitalise a local church. Pray that God would bless their endeavours, and this would be effective in reaching the local area for Christ.
* Pray for James as he leads the Diocese's church planting strategy under God for the next 5 years - pray for God's help and wisdom, and that he would enable us to reach corners of the country where there is no bible church currently.
