* Praise God for gospel opportunities on the Becontree estate. Pray for the team going out for doorstep conversations, that these and the follow up cards might sow gospel truth. 
* Pray for the church to keep loving and serving one another, and not stopping meeting together, either on Sunday or midweek. 
* Pray for the elders, Kenny & Rob, and the trustees, to have one mind in making decisions for the progress of the gospel. 
* Pray for the appointment of an assistant minister, and for them as they settle into the area and the new role.
