* Please pray that the work Connie and her team are doing will equip students across the UK to confidently live and speak for Jesus in their lectures, seminars and studios.
* Pray for Connie and her team to live godly lives which are characterised by sacrificial service.
* Pray for Connie as she finishes working with UCCF in the summer - that she would finish well, for a good handover to Ben Harding and for wisdom as she puts things in place for the Networks for the 2021-22 academic year.
