* Pray that as a church we would be growing in our love for the Lord, the lost and for each other.
* We remain without our own church building. Give thanks for the ways weâ€™ve seen the Lord provide in the past and for wisdom as we continue to look for a solution. 
* Pray for the evening service launching in Spring 2022. Pray this will provide opportunities for us to grow in love and in number. 
* Pray for us and our four teenage children, that our hearts will be gripped by the grace and glory of the Lord Jesus Christ in all we do.
