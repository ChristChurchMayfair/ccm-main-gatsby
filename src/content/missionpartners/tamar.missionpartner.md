There has been a huge interruption to the industry of sexual exploitation during the pandemic. It has made some more vulnerable but has also made buying and selling more difficult.
* Pray that more will break free from the control of others, and that alternative work becomes possible for those looking for a way out.
* Pray for justice and healing for those harmed through abuse and exploitation.
* Pray for Tamar’s ministry during and after the pandemic – that Tamar will be able to continue outreach and support and reconnect with the women they have lost contact with during Covid-19.
