* Praise God for the amazing gospel opportunity of Becontree, where everyone has a front door, and a rain shelter (archway)!
* Pray for the team going out for doorstep conversations, that these and the follow up cards might sow gospel truth.
* Pray for the church to keep loving and serving one another, and not stopping meeting together, either on Sunday or mid-week.
* Pray for elders Kenny & Rob, and the trustees, to have one mind in making decisions for the progress of the gospel.
* Pray for the appointment of an assistant minister, and as they settle into the area, and the new role.
