* Pray that God would continue to raise up workers for the harvest field in New Zealand.
* Pray that God would lay on people's hearts the desire to start a new church in a local UPA, and that some people would sign up for this.
* Pray that the children (Victoria, Charlie and Freddie) would follow the Lord and serve him.
