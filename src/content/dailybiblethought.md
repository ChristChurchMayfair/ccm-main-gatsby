Daily Bible Thought
=============================

Lent ended on Easter Day and so did our Digital Fast, Biblical Feast daily emails. However, we're going to continue sending a short daily bible thought through to anyone who'd appreciate it.

You can either follow the link in the email to a video version or just read the email at your own pace.

How to get involved
-------------------

If you're already on the Digital Fast email list, you don't need to do anything. To sign up just enter your email address here and hit subscribe to get Daily Bible Thought email delivered to you each morning. This list is separate from other Christ Church Mayfair mailing lists and will only ever be used for emailing you for these Daily Bible Thought emails and for nothing else. You can unsubscribe at any time using the link at the bottom of the email.
