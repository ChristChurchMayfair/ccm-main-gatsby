Attending Church in Person
==============================

In light of most lockdown restrictions ending and the guidance that has been issued by the Church of England and others, 
we are delighted to meet more fully in person, but are still choosing to retain some measures to keep us safe.

Our great longing is that the whole church family will be able to come back to gather physically, and will feel safe doing so. 

Check-in
----------------

You will no longer need to book before coming to church. 
We will, however, ask you either to scan the NHS track and trace QR code when you arrive, or to scan a CCM QR code to give us your details. 

We strongly encourage you to keep using the hand sanitizer provided at the entrance.

Face Coverings and Singing
----------------

We rejoice we can sing again!

The government states that it "expects and recommends" people wear face coverings in crowded, enclosed settings to protect themselves and others. 
Because our building is large and we will not be facing one another, we won't require you to wear a face covering during the service,
but we do ask that you ***please wear a face covering when singing.***

Out of consideration to others at a time when the number of cases is rising, we also ask that you ***please wear a face covering when moving around the building.***

Spacing
----------------
We are now permitted to sit next to people not in our households, but please be considerate and check that people are happy to have you sit next to them.

Extra Precautions Area
----------------

We will set out seating in the transept (on the right near the entrance doors) with additional spacing for those who want it. 

We ask that everyone who sits in this area wears a face covering throughout the service. 

Loos
----------------

Loos will be available as normal but if there's someone waiting, we suggest you come back later rather than hanging around.

Covid Syptoms
----------------

If you have any covid symptoms, we ask that you please don't come to church and follow the relevant NHS advice.

More Information
----------------

Please do join us in continuing to pray that CCM is a safe place for everyone to come, and that we would be able to continue meeting together.

Please get in touch with [the office](mailto:info@christchurchmayfair.org) if you have any questions or concerns about this.
