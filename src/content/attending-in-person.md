Attending Church in Person
==============================

We are delighted to be able to continue meeting in person, including being able to sing again in Church!

In light of guidance issued by the Church of England and others, we will retain some measures to help keep us safe.

Please read below to see what to expect when we gather together on Sundays.

Our great longing is that the whole church family will be able to come back to gather physically and feel safe doing so. 

Check-in
----------------

You will no longer need to book before coming to church. 
We will, however, ask you either to scan the NHS track and trace QR code when you arrive or to scan a CCM QR code to give us your details. 

We strongly encourage you to keep using the hand sanitiser provided at the entrance.

Face Coverings and Singing
----------------

We rejoice that we can sing again!

The government states that it *"expects and recommends"* people wear face coverings in crowded, enclosed settings to protect themselves and others. 
Since our building is large and we will not be facing one another, we won't require you to wear a face covering during the service,
but we do ask that you ***please wear a face covering when singing.***

Out of consideration to others at a time when the number of cases is rising, we also ask that you ***please wear a face covering when moving around the building.***

Spacing
----------------
We are now permitted to sit next to anyone, regardless of if you live together. Please be considerate, though, and check that people are happy to have you sit next to them.

Extra Precautions Area
----------------

We will set out seating in the transept (on the right near the entrance doors) with additional spacing for those who want it. 

We ask everyone sitting in this area to please wear a face covering throughout the service. 

Loos
----------------

Toilet facilities will be available as normal but if people are waiting, we suggest you come back later rather than hanging around.

Covid Symptoms
----------------

If you have any covid symptoms, please don't come to church and follow the relevant NHS advice.

More Information
----------------

Please do join us in continuing to pray that CCM is a safe place for everyone to come and that we would be able to continue meeting together.

Please get in touch with [the office](mailto:info@christchurchmayfair.org) if you have any questions or concerns about this.
