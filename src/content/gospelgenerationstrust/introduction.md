The Elders at Christ Church Mayfair have been encouraged by some former members of the church to establish a Trust to help support the Ministry Intern scheme.

This programme gives the opportunity for a number of young people each year to:

* To gain deep convictions of the necessity of word ministry
* To be trained in the fundamental principles and skills of various Gospel ministries.
* To develop an appreciation of their own strengths and weaknesses so that they can pursue the best future training and work for their gifts
* 
Ministry interns, formerly known as apprentices and ministry trainees, work full time or part time with church staff for one to two years. They are a great blessing to the church in the practical service they undertake, but the primary aim of the scheme is to train them to serve the Lord elsewhere in the future.

We are therefore appealing to former members of CCM who have seen the value of the scheme to consider financial and prayerful support, so that we can equip and send more young men and women into Gospel ministry. The most desperate need of our world is the training and deployment of workers to proclaim the Gospel that saves people from hell for heaven for eternity.

Please have a read of the following information and prayerfully consider if this is something you would like and are able to support.

Yours warmly in Christ,

**Matt Fuller**

Vicar of Christ Church Mayfair
