The **Gospel Generations Trust** provides financial support for young people on the **Christ Church Mayfair Ministry Internship Scheme**.

Since the church's founding in 2001, dozens of young men and women completed the scheme. Ministry interns typically spend one to two years working alongside church staff, gaining valuable experience serving in all kinds of Gospel ministries.

Ministry interns are a great practical blessing to the church, but the primary aim of the scheme is to train them to serve the Lord elsewhere in the future. During their internship they will:

* Gain deep convictions of the necessity of word ministry
* Be trained in the fundamental principles and skills of various Gospel ministries.
* Develop an appreciation of their own strengths and weaknesses so that they can pursue the best future training and work for their gifts

On completion many choose to continue in ministry in the UK or overseas, and others go on to academic training or move into secular work.
