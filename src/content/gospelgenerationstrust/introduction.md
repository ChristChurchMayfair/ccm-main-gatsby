Since Christ Church Mayfair was planted in 2001, we have operated a scheme for ministry interns or apprentices. The Gospel Generations Trust gives the opportunity for a number of young people each year to work in Christ Church Mayfair through providing financial support for ministry internships.

Dozens of young men and women have spent one or two years working alongside the staff to gain experience and to be shaped by gospel priorities before heading straight into ministry in the UK or overseas, returning to secular work or going on to academic training.

> Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the LORD of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field."
> 
> Matthew 9:37-38 (NIV)

Ministry interns are a great blessing to the church in the practical service they undertake, but the primary aim of the scheme is to train them to serve the Lord elsewhere in the future. During their internship they will:

* Gain deep convictions of the necessity of word ministry
* Be trained in the fundamental principles and skills of various Gospel ministries.
* Develop an appreciation of their own strengths and weaknesses so that they can pursue the best future training and work for their gifts

We are therefore asking you to consider financial and prayerful support, so that we can equip and send more young men and women into Gospel ministry.  The most desperate need of our world is the training and deployment of workers to proclaim the Gospel that saves people from hell for heaven for eternity.

## Partner with us
Gospel ministry requires sacrifice in terms of lifestyle and the scheme is part of learning how to manage this.  It is run as a training programme for volunteers, and the apprentices are strongly encouraged to raise money for themselves.  However, we also want to enable people to participate who struggle to raise enough funds. Funding is required for expenses associated with training such as workshop and conferences, and also for living expenses, including for grants for those who are not able to raise funds to support themselves.  The fund will distribute money as required to further the aims of the ministry trainee scheme.

While initially we will be concentrating on CCM based ministry trainees, if funding permits we also hope to open this out to Ministry Interns from other churches in the Co-mission network.
