## How can you help?

The Ministry Internship requires finance to pay for excellent training at Cornhill and Co-Mission workshops, resources for mission and ministry, and living costs. We believe that the cost of training and resourcing Ministry Interns should not be a barrier to those who wish to enter the training scheme.

Your contribution will enable more men and women to become a Ministry Intern, many of whom could not do so without financial support. Ministry Interns are strongly encouraged to raise money for themselves, but where this is not possible this fund can provide essential support.

Gifts through the fund will primarily serve Ministry Interns at CCM, but as funding permits we also hope to resource Ministry Interns at partner churches in the Co-Mission network in the future.
