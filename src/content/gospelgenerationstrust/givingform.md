All Gospel ministry requires sacrifice in terms of lifestyle and the internship scheme involves learning how to manage this.

The ministry internship scheme is run as a training programme for volunteers, and the interns are strongly encouraged to raise money for themselves. However, we also want to enable people to participate who would struggle to raise enough money.

Funding is required for expenses associated with training such as workshop and conferences, and also for living expenses, including for grants for those who are not able to raise funds to support themselves. The fund will distribute money as required to further the aims of the ministry trainee scheme.

Note: *Initially the Gospel Generations Trust will prioritise supporting ministry interns at Christ Church Mayfair. However, if there are sufficient funds we hope to offer financial support to ministry interns at other churches in the Co-Mission network.*
