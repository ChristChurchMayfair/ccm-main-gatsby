Congregation Survey
=============

Thank you for taking the time to fill in CCM's annual survey which gives us helpful stats that we can use, among other things, to assess some of the practical needs of the church family. 

Please complete this form if you are aged 18+ and attended one of our services today either in person or online. It should take you only a minute or two. For under 18s, please could a parent answer the questions below on their behalf.

Please fill in one form for each person watching, and for each service you attend. 

This survey is anonymous, please do not share any personal information which could be used to identify you.
