# COVID-19 Policy & Risk Assessment

_Version 1.2_

First date of implementation: 14 July 2020

## 1. Purpose

1. This policy is written to serve the church family, visitors and staff of Christ Church Mayfair for services and midweek bible study meetings in the building.

2. This policy will be reviewed:
a) as our activities change e.g. if midweek Bible studies become possible;
b) every month or more frequently if the Covid-10 situation changes and/or government/Church of England guidance varies in a way that would impact our meetings.

## 2. Principles

1. We believe that the Bible teaches it is important for believers to meet together as a body wherever possible.
2. We will aim to create an environment that makes it easy for people to adhere to government guidance and to reduce the risk of people catching or spreading Covid-19 as far as we are able.
3. Staff and elders will lead by example.
4. We will expect people to adhere to the principles and will encourage people to do so where possible.
5. We are committed to following the latest government and Church of England guidance which can be found online: [Church of England Guidance](https://www.churchofengland.org/more/media-centre/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-churches) and [Government Guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-places-of-worship-from-4-july/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-places-of-worship-from-4-july) which is regularly updated.

## 3. CCM Church Context

1. The context of this policy and risk assessment is within a plan to have service in church.
2. As the majority of the church family are under the age of 50, gathering together (in a safe manner) will not be a cause of great concern for many but we are concerned to protect as far as possible those who are more vulnerable and to welcome all ages safely to our building. CCM also has a duty of care to its staff and interns.
3. For those who are concerned or who have to self-isolate/shield at home, as well as the number excluded by the restrictions the amount of physical space permits, live streaming will continue in order to be as inclusive as possible.

The church family were asked in a survey between 1st and 6th July for their opinion about church services restarting and in what format. We received 183 responses (from both individuals and households) and their thoughts and concerns have been taken into account.

## 4. Background

1. COVID-19 (also known as SARS-CoV-19) is a new type of coronavirus which was originally identified in Wuhan, China.  Coronaviruses are a family of viruses which cause a range of illnesses; these include the common cold and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).  The virus can be spread by direct droplet spread produced by coughing and sneezing but also by touching something contaminated with the virus (e.g. objects or surfaces) and then touching their face, nose or mouth.
2. The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing, but some patients may have serious complications including pneumonia and renal failure. Many individuals do not display symptoms but may be infectious. Those who are older or with underlying medical problems are at higher risk of the serious manifestations.

## 6. Capacity

Asking for sign-ups will allow us to determine the maximum number who can attend for any event

Chairs will be laid out in rows spaced 2m apart and congregation asked to leave 2 empty seats between households. The transept will have individual/pairs of seats laid out to enable anyone who might require greater distance around them to do so. With this layout and if balcony can be used for 3 households at distance of 2m apart the maximum capacity is approximately 80. 

For weddings the maximum allowed is 15 excluding officiant and verger/intern provided by church.

See Appendix 1

## 7. Communications

1. The church family will be reminded when invitations to midweek meetings and Sunday services (and weddings) are issued that those who are vulnerable, shielding or self-isolating should remain at home and that those showing symptoms or self-isolating should not attend.

2. The record of those signing up for each midweek bible study and Sunday service will be retained on ChurchSuite with additional names/contacts e.g newcomers retained by the church office for 21 days following GDPR although we will not compel people to give their names and contacts. A photograph of the room will be taken to show which people were near others and retained for 21 days. For weddings the bride and groom will be asked to submit a list of the names of attendees in advance of the wedding which will be retained for 21 days (and which will allow the seat layout to be configured). If anyone submits their name for attendance, it will be assumed they attended, even if they pull out at the last minute. These lists will be made available to the government Track & Trace programme if necessary.

3. At the end of each service those present are asked to let the church office know if they develop symptoms of Covid 19 within 72 hours of being at church. If the church becomes aware of an individual who attended the service who has confirmed coronavirus, or who is likely to have coronavirus, advice will be sought from the local PHE Health Protection Team.

## 8. Governance

This has been drawn up by Sharon Walsh in consultation with the Elders and other members of CCM.

# Appendices

## Appendix 1 - Maximum Capacity

Asking for sign-ups will allow us to determine the maximum who can attend for any event:

-   majority of rows of seats at 2m distance and leaving 2 empty chairs between households + seats in transept laid out with individual/pairs of seats at 2m all around means a capacity of approx. 80 
-   For weddings the maximum allowed by government guidelines is 15 including officiant but excluding verger/intern provided by church.

## Appendix 2 - Safe Recording Process

### Cleaning headset mics

One headset will be supplied per preacher, it should be labelled and only touched by the preacher & recorder
Recorder wipes all down with alcohol wipes before and after the recording

### For each recording

1. Recorder puts batteries in beltpack, screws specific headset into beltpack
2. Recorder checks signal is being received into the sound desk from the headset, and that the signal is going into the recording software
3. Recorder wipes down all externals of headset & beltpack and leaves on a clean table
4. Preacher collects headset & beltpack from table and fits it as normal for a Sunday Service
5. Preacher does a test recording of roughly 2 minutes
6. Recorder checks the test recording to ensure sound and video are coming in clearly
7. Full recording of segments, do each segment in a separate recording
8. Preacher removes headset/beltpack and leaves on the clean table
9. Recorder removes batteries from beltpack and puts to charge, then cleans the beltpack and headset
10. Recorder puts headset in sealed ziplock bag that has preacher’s name on a label
11. Recorder wipes down table that had headset/beltpack on it

### Lectern mic

1. If the lectern mic needs to be used, the process is the same as the headsets in regards to wiping down the lectern stand, the microphone spine etc.
2. The outside cover of the mic (windshield) is to be replaced after each use.
3. Any used windshields are to be put in a ziplock bag and labelled clearly as needing to be washed

## Appendix 3 - Cleaning Checklist

The infection risk from coronavirus (COVID-19) following contamination of the environment decreases over time. It is not yet clear at what point there is no risk. However, studies of other viruses in the same family suggest that, in most circumstances, the risk is likely to be reduced significantly after 72 hours.
