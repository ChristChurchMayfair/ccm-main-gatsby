# Resources

Here are some helpful resources.

## Christianity Explored

This is a fantastic 6 part video series which explores the heart of the Christian faith by looking at the Gospel of Mark. You can watch the videos online on the [Christianity Explored YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1s_pw2-9zCau6SJ_kmlvA) and follow it up with a couple of discussion questions. 

### Tricky Questions
Often our friends have difficult questions about the Christian faith. Here are 2 short video series addressing common questions. You can use these to help you answer, or share them with friends.

[Tough Questions](https://www.ceministries.org/Groups/276317/Home/CE_ORG/Tough_Questions/Tough_Questions.aspx) and [Thorny Questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL4zD5797LHdewlH1eEDTSBD8IwW7CCKEE&v=o_oAw9t0oOc)

### Reading the Bible Online

#### Uncover

This is a great looking website with seeker bible studies for 3 of the Gospels (I recommend you start with Luke). The heart of each session is some Bible text and great discussion questions. There are some great supplementary videos, but these are optional.

#### The Word 121

Some people find it quite awkward to be asked questions they might not immediately know the answer to. For people like that The Word 121 is great. You look at the text together and there are some helpful explanatory notes down the side of the page. 

Here is a page of tips and advice on how to use it, including video of an experienced user showing us itâ€™s done, which I highly recommend watching:
