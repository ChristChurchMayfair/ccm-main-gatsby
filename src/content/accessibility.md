Accessibility at Christ Church
==============================

Wheelchair Users
----------------

We regret that our building is not easily accessible for those in wheelchairs and with mobility issues. We are seeking to address this and are currently requesting permissions from the Diocese of London for alterations that will improve access and facilities. 

We have a temporary ramp that can be put in place to help wheelchairs into the building.

We are sorry we don't currently have an accessible toilet.

Diasabled Badge Parking
-----------------------

Please visit the Westminster City Council website for more information about parking for white/blue badge holders: [https://www.westminster.gov.uk/where-you-can-park-disabled-badge](https://www.westminster.gov.uk/where-you-can-park-disabled-badge)

Assistance Dogs
---------------

Guide dogs, hearing dogs and assistance dogs are welcome at any of our meetings.

Assistance for the Hard of Hearing
----------------------------------

An infrared hearing support system is available, with both neck loop receivers for use with a hearing aid and stethoset receivers. Please ask someone on the welcome team for assistance before the service.

More Information
